        Whether it's a personal website, an online calculator, a financial hub for a student organization or a mobile app released on IOS.
        I enjoy being able to sit down and, from nothing, create something unique and personal with nothing but a keyboard, my wits, and abut 100 Google searches a minute.

        Traveling is one of the most enjoyable things in life, and what better way to remember your travels than with photos. With a little bit of effort, a nice camera, and the self-confidence
        to look like <strong>that</strong> tourist at any given time, anyone can get lucky and get the shot of a lifetime. Or at least one good enough to throw up on IG for a few likes.
