Dear Ms. Ebadat,

This new Career Fair Application will be used mainly by students to help organize their visit to the SEC Career Fair. In our initial release users will be able to view a map of the event venue, view a full list of all the companies and organizations in attendance along with details regarding each company and organization. These details include information such as what majors/qualifications that company is looking for, contact information for that company along with their booth number and location at that respective Career Fair. The app will also allow users to add personalized notes to any company and include them on a "Favorites List". This app will continue to develop each Career Fair and we look forward to adding new and exciting features in the near future.

In regards to where your company's information will be used, the logo will be used in your respective listing so that your company is more easily recognizable. Both the information you provide in any email correspondence and in the Career Fair registration process will be used only for that semesters Career Fair. If you have any other questions, comments, or concerns do not hesitate to contact us again.

Best Regards,
